# Question

We have a function `return_false()` that uses both comparison and boolean
operators:

```plaintext
def return_false(x):
    return 7 > 4 and 100 < x
```

What value(s) for `x` will make `return_false()` return `False`?

## Correct

100

> Right! For the `&` operator to return `False`, both sides of the operator must
> be `False`

## Incorrect

101

> &nbsp; &nbsp;
> 
> For the `&` operator to return `False`, both sides of the operator must
> be`False`. `100 < 101` evaluates to `True`, so this would return `True`

## Incorrect

102

> &nbsp; &nbsp;
>
