# Question

What will this code print out?

```plaintext
name = "Steven"

print(f"Hi, {name}." if name != "Steven" else f"Goodbye, {name}.")
```

## Correct

Goodbye, Steven.

> Right! Since `name != "Steven"` is `False`, our `else` condition will be printed
> instead.

## Incorrect

Hi, Steven.

> Since `name != "Steven"` is `False`, our `else` condition will be printed
> instead.

## Incorrect

Hi, {name}.

> Remember that fStrings are formatted with the valuables of any variable names
> inside of curly brackets `{}`. This means that we will see the value of `name`in
> our output. Since `name != "Steven"` is `False`, our `else` condition will be
> printed instead.

## Incorrect

I don't know.
