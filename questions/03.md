# Question

What will this `while` loop do?

```
x = 0

while x < 10:
    print("so many loops")
```

## Correct

Output "so many loops" infinitely.

> Right! Since we never change the value of `x`, `x` will always be less than 10.
> The condition for the `while` loop is always `True`.

## Incorrect

Output "so many loops" one time.

> Since we never change the value of `x`, `x` will always be less than 10. The
> condition for the `while` loop is always `True`.

## Incorrect

Output "so many loops" 10 times.

> Since we never change the value of `x`, `x` will always be less than 10. The
> condition for the `while` loop is always `True`.

## Incorrect
