# Question

We have a function `use_truthiness()` that should return `True`:

```plaintext
def use_truthiness(x):
    return 7 > 8 or x
```

What value(s) for `x` will make this function return `True`? Select all that
apply.

## Correct

`True`

> Right! With the `or` operator, either the left side or the right side must be
> truthy in order for the operator to return `True`.

## Incorrect

`False`

> With the `or` operator, either the left side or the right side must be truthy in
> order fort he operator to return `True`. In this case, neither `7 > 8`
> nor`False` are truthy.

## Incorrect

I don't know.
