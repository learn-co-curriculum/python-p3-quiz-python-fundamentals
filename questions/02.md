# Question

What will this code print out?

```
name = "Steven"

print(f"Hi, {name}." if name == "Steven" else f"Goodbye, {name}.")
```

## Correct

Hi, Steven.

> Right! Since `name == "Steven"` is `True`, our first condition will be printed
> with `name` formatted into the fString.

## Incorrect

Goodbye, Steven.

> Since `name == "Steven"` is `True`, our first condition, &nbsp;`f"Hi, {name}."`
> will be printed with `name` formatted into the fString.

## Incorrect

Hi, {name}.

> Remember that fStrings are formatted with the valuables of any variable names
> inside of curly brackets `{}`. This means that we will see the value of `name`
> in our output. Since `name == "Steven"` is `True`, our first condition will be
> printed with `Steven` replacing `{name}`.

## Incorrect

I don't know.
