# Question

What is the value of `string` after this code has executed?

```
def print_param(param):
    print(param)

string = print_param("hello")
```

## Correct

`None`

> Right! A function call only returns the values in its `return` statement. Since
> `print_param()` does not have a `return` statement, it returns `None`

## Incorrect

hello

> Almost- `print_param()` prints `hello`, but a function call only returns the
> values in its `return` statement. Since `print_param()` does not have a `return`
> statement, it returns `None`

## Incorrect

param

> Remember that a function call only returns the values in its `return` statement.
> Since `print_param()` does not have a `return` statement, it returns `None`
> 
> _Also:_ remember that any parameters that are passed to a function can be
> referenced by their name throughout. `print_param()` prints `param`'s value,
> `hello`.

## Incorrect

I don't know.
