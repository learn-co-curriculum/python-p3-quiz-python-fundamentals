# Question

What would be the output of the following statement?

```
letter = "b"

if (letter == "a" or
    letter == "e" or
    letter == "i" or
    letter == "o" or
    letter == "u"):
    # Begin "if" block
    print("vowel.")
else:
    # Begin "else" block
    print("not a vowel.")
```

## Correct

not a vowel.

> Right! The `or` operators for the `if` condition will all evaluate to `False`.

## Incorrect

vowel.

> Not quite- The `or` operators for the `if` condition will all evaluate to
> `False`.
