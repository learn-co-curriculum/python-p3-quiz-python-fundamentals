# Question

When is it a good idea to use an&nbsp;`if/else`&nbsp;statement instead of a
ternary operator (conditional expression)? Select all that apply.

## Correct

When the&nbsp;`if`&nbsp;statement is complex with
multiple&nbsp;`elif`&nbsp;conditions

> The ternary operator can be more challenging to read when there are multiple
> branching conditions.

## Correct

When the conditional logic would require nested ternary operators

> The ternary operator can be more challenging to read when it requires nesting.

## Correct

When the ternary operator would take up more than one line

> If using a ternary operator makes your code harder to read, it's better to use a
> regular&nbsp;`if/else`&nbsp;statement.

## Incorrect

I don't know.
