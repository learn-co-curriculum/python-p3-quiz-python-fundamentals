# Question

Here is a repeated list of `print()` statements.

```plaintext
print("hi")
print("hi")
print("hi")
print("hi")
print("hi")
```

How would you repeat this with a `while` loop 100 times?

## Correct

```plaintext
counter = 0

while counter < 100:
    print("hi")
    counter += 1
```

> Right! Since we start the counter at 0 and keep it running as long as the
> counter is less than 100, this will loop 100 times (starting from 0 and
> continuing until the counter is 99).

## Incorrect

```plaintext
counter = 1

while counter < 100:
    print("hi")
    counter += 1
```

> Close, but not quite. Since the counter starts at one and the while loop only
> runs while the counter is&nbsp; **less than** &nbsp;100, this will only run our

## Incorrect

```plaintext
while True:
    print("hi")
```

> Be careful with this one â€” since the condition will always
> be&nbsp;`True`&nbsp;and there's no&nbsp;`break`&nbsp;from the loop, this will

## Incorrect

I don't know.
