# Question

Which of the following functions would correctly return `True` when given the
letter `"o"` as an argument?

## Correct

```
def check_vowel(letter):
    return (letter == "a" or
            letter == "e" or
            letter == "i" or
            letter == "o" or
            letter == "u")
```

> Right! We can use the `or` operator to check if the letter matches any vowel.

## Incorrect

```
def check_vowel(letter):
    return (letter == "a" and
            letter == "e" and
            letter == "i" and
            letter == "o" and
            letter == "u")
```

> The `and` operator won't work here, since it only returns `True` if both sides
> of the operator are truthy. A letter can't be `"a"`, `"e"`, `"i"`, `"o"`, and
> `"u"` simultaneously!

## Incorrect

I don't know.
